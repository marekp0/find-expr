# find-expr 
Finds solutions for the types of problems in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ruC5A9EzzE).
Built specifically for solving the problem for 10958. There seems to be no solutions, at least
according to the rules in the video.  `find-expr` tries to be relatively fast, so it uses 
multithreading and a sort of virtual machine.

## Usage
```
make
./find-expr 10958
```

## Output format
An expression, followed by the order of the operations.

## Future Work
Make the output format more easily readable
